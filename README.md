A chatbot built on the Textblob library in Python. The bot is deployed using Python. I plan to implement seq2seq analysis in the future on top of this basic polarity and subjectivity sentiment analysis. Make sure to start your own virtual environment before using the code as it will help you to isolate your dependencies from other python resources. The code is supposed to work on flask deployment as well. It basically takes your sentiment into account based on your replies which is measure using the polarity [1 -  -1] and the subjectivity [0-9]. This is a very simple yet helpful solution to mock up a real quick helper. This was my first time working with text mining and sentiment analysis. At first I decided to work based on a dataset model training but textblob seemed to do the almost same thing much more easily compared to NLK and spacy. In future I would like to  implement use of BERT model into same sort of scenarion. And my ultimate goal is to make a bot with seq2seq analysis and deep learning where it wont decide responses based on a preset dictionary.
